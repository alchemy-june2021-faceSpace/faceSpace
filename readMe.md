# COMMUNICATION PLAN:

We will voice any concerns verbally without any discrimination. If opinions collide, we will do a group vote to determine the best plan of action. If we are tied for a vote, it may be necessary to bring in a T.A. or Vonta to determine which direction our project should go.

# WORK PLAN:

Kanban boards to setup our TODOs, such as routes, authentication, etc.Tasks will be assigned through pairs, utilizing pair programming, and determining which group members would like to focus on certain details. We will also have a list of daily goals, with the end goal being our MVP by Tuesday afternoon-evening.
If stuck for longer than 15 minutes, ask TA or group member for help.
Pair programming: Switch off partners roles, then switch partners to keep the work evenly spread out.

# GIT Process:

2 people to merge PRs.
If merge conflict, bring entire group to discuss the conflict.
Join breakout room if the teams aren't in the main room by the merge time.
Morning standups to go over the daily goals and any barriers related to impeding workflow.
MERGE TIME: 11:45ish, 4:45ish
Work on weekend will be avoided.
Break times on the hour, minimum every 2 hours.
